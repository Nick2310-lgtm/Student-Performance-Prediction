# Student Performance Prediction - Group 55 (Mini Project)

This project reproduces and extends the paper **“Student Performance Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms” (Ahmed, 2024, Wiley Journal)**. It predicts student performance using socio-economic and academic features with multiple machine learning models.

## Setup & Usage
Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Train models and save results:

    python src/train_models.py

Evaluate performance:

    python src/evaluate.py

## Outputs
- Trained models and preprocessor: `results/models/`
- Evaluation metrics: `results/metrics/results.json`
